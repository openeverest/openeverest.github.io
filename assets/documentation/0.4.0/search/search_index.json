Creating a new database allows you to examine the original database for vulnerabilities or issues before restoring the data. This can help identify weaknesses that need to be addressed.</p> </li> <li> <p>When you want to validate backup data before restore: By creating a new database, you can test the integrity and consistency of the backup data before making it the primary production data.

Creating a new database allows you to apply the necessary upgrades or patches to the new environment, ensuring that the production environment is up-to-date and secure.</p> </li> <li> <p>To create a safety net for rollbacks: Restoring the backup directly to the original database leaves little room for rolling back the recovery process if issues are discovered later.
