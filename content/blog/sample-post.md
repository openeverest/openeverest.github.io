Welcome to the Everest Open Source project blog!

This is a sample blog post to demonstrate the structure and capabilities of our Hugo-powered website.

## What is Everest?

Everest is an open source project dedicated to innovation and collaboration. Our mission is to create powerful, accessible tools that empower developers and communities worldwide.

## Blog Structure

All blog posts are written in Markdown and include frontmatter with the following information:

- **Title**: The post title
- **Date**: Publication date
- **Draft**: Whether the post is a draft (true/false)
- **Image**: Optional featured image with URL and attribution
- **Authors**: List of post authors
- **Tags**: Categories and topics
- **Summary**: Brief description of the post

## Getting Started

To create a new blog post, use the following command:

```bash
hugo new content/blog/your-post-title.md
```

This will create a new Markdown file with the proper frontmatter template.
