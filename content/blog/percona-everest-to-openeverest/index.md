summary: Percona is transitioning Percona Everest into an independent open source project called OpenEverest, designed to operate with open governance and a growing, multi-vendor community.
---

We're excited to announce a significant milestone in the evolution of [Percona](https://percona.com) Everest: **the project is transitioning to become OpenEverest**, an independent open source project with open governance and a thriving, multi-vendor community.

## What's Changing?

Percona Everest is becoming **OpenEverest** - an independent open source project designed to welcome broad participation from individuals, partners, and organizations across the industry. This transition reflects our commitment to open source principles and enables the project to grow beyond a single-vendor solution.

### Key Highlights

- **Open Governance**: OpenEverest will operate with transparent, community-driven governance
- **Multi-Vendor Community**: The project welcomes contributors, maintainers, and ecosystem partners from across the industry
- **Community-Driven Roadmap**: Evolution guided by community needs, not commercial priorities
- **CNCF Ecosystem Integration**: Deeper engagement with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and the broader cloud-native ecosystem

## Why This Matters

We are evolving OpenEverest into a fully extensible platform. While our current focus is on specific database management, our roadmap is centered on creating a modular foundation that can support:

- **New Databases**: Seamlessly plug in additional data engines.
- **Custom Integrations**: Connect with your entire operational stack.
- **Operational Scale**: Address a broader range of data infrastructure use cases.

Our goal is to transform OpenEverest from a single-purpose tool into a community-driven ecosystem. You can read the full breakdown of this journey at [vision.openeverest.io](vision.openeverest.io).

## Commercial Support

OpenEverest’s independence is backed by a robust support ecosystem. Percona remains a key contributor and partner, ensuring that existing users continue to receive the world-class services they expect.

Joining this ecosystem is [Solanica](https://solanica.io), a new organization focused entirely on OpenEverest. Solanica’s goal is to drive the project’s technical roadmap and nurture its community while offering an enterprise-grade platform and professional services for organizations that need a deeper level of partnership.

## What This Means for You

If you're currently using Percona Everest:

✅ **Continuity**: No disruption to your existing deployments  
✅ **Stability**: Continued enterprise-grade reliability and security  
✅ **Support**: Percona, Solanica and more organizations are ready to help  
✅ **Innovation**: Benefit from a more open ecosystem and faster evolution driven by a larger community
