summary: Percona is transitioning Percona Everest into an independent open source project called OpenEverest, designed to operate with open governance and a growing, multi-vendor community.
---

We're excited to announce a significant milestone in the evolution of [Percona](https://percona.com) Everest: **the project is transitioning to become OpenEverest**, an independent open source project with open governance and a thriving, multi-vendor community.

## What's Changing?

Percona Everest is becoming **OpenEverest** - an independent open source project designed to welcome broad participation from individuals, partners, and organizations across the industry. This transition reflects our commitment to open source principles and enables the project to grow beyond a single-vendor solution.

### What's Different

OpenEverest will operate with transparent, community-driven governance, moving away from single-vendor control. The project now welcomes contributors, maintainers, and ecosystem partners from across the industry, creating a truly multi-vendor community. Instead of following commercial priorities, the roadmap will evolve based on what the community actually needs. This also means deeper engagement with the Cloud Native Computing Foundation and the broader cloud-native ecosystem.

## Why This Matters

We're building OpenEverest as a fully extensible platform. Right now, we're focused on database management, but the real vision is bigger than that. We're creating a modular foundation where you can seamlessly plug in additional data engines, connect with your entire operational stack, and tackle a broader range of data infrastructure challenges.

Think of it this way: we're moving from a single-purpose tool to a community-driven ecosystem. The full breakdown of where we're headed is at [vision.openeverest.io](vision.openeverest.io).

## Commercial Support

OpenEverest’s independence is backed by a robust support ecosystem. Percona remains a key contributor and partner, ensuring that existing users continue to receive the world-class services they expect.

Joining this ecosystem is [Solanica](https://solanica.io), a new organization focused entirely on OpenEverest. Solanica’s goal is to drive the project’s technical roadmap and nurture its community while offering an enterprise-grade platform and professional services for organizations that need a deeper level of partnership.

## What This Means for You

If you're currently using Percona Everest:

✅ **Continuity**: No disruption to your existing deployments  
✅ **Stability**: Continued enterprise-grade reliability and security  
✅ **Support**: Percona, Solanica and more organizations are ready to help  
✅ **Innovation**: Benefit from a more open ecosystem and faster evolution driven by a larger community
